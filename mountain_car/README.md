# MountainCar With DQN and Q-learning

This program is about mountain car which is gym's game with deep neural network and q learning method. As Neural network library, I used Pytorch.

# Problem formulation

## Actions

- go left
- go right

## States

- position of cart
- velocity of cart

Therefore, we can learn by using q-learning methods and deep Q learning methods.

# DQN

I implemented the following methods to basic dqn.

- Experience replay

# Usage

- Q-learning

```
$ python Q_learning.py
```

- DQN

```
$ python Q_learning.py
```

about the DQN, it is extremely difficult to set the epsilon greedy parameter.
If you can not get the good reasult, please change the parameter.

# Expected Results

- Q-learning




- DQN
